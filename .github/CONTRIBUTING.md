# Contributing to cubercnn
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process
This codebase focuses on reproducing results of Cube R-CNN from the Omni3D
project. However, the code and techniques used could be improved in many ways. 
Hence, we encourage suggestions and extensions. 

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Train and report performance of all models (and baselines if applicable).
5. Make sure your code lints `./infra/linter.sh`.
6. If a PR contains multiple orthogonal changes, split it to several PRs.
7. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
